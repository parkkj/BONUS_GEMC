1/ how to create bank structure into ROOT file ?
[Solution]
 evio2root -B=bonus -WRITE_RAWS=No -INPUTF=bonus_gemc_out.evio
=> ROOT fiel contains the "xbonus" bank
=> You need to kill al other bank structure which are empty

2/ BONUS raw data: 
 ADC energy deposition (charge integration)
 Time information (TDC) from GEM or GEM+WC
[Q1] Need to know what/how integrate the proton deposit energy into ADC
[Q2] where we get TDC info ? from 1st layer of wire chamber ? 

3/ Need a drift velocity information in term of gas mixture and pressure
=> Gail is calculating average....

4/ Manipulate the B-field and E-field ?? possible...Do we need this ?
[Q] Alternatively, we can have extra-step, which is MegaBolt code for drift time cal.
=> This is "3/" issue.


5/ How to stop tracking outside of BONUS
=> To avoid particle not back into detector again
[Q] Why low momentum proton track is still passing through entire materials ?
[Solution] When the geometry's created, it should be "mother=root" !!
Then you see the track is trapped by even PCB...

6/ How to build the first layer of wire (geometry) in the BONUS.... 
[Q] Is this final design ? or even possible ? No....
[A] no need a further study....because there is a big dis-adventage for detecting lower momentum of proton (lost VIP)

7/ ROHACELL simulation....
(a) Need to figure what what material is ....
[Solution] Actually, it is already defined in the BST material packages
In addition, I copied the pc Board as well.


8/ hit_Process with ElectronTraport information from the MagBoltz (G. Dodge)
a) Jixie has a draft version of G4 code implemting electron drift information.
b) need to modify his code for GEMC....currently GEMC has integrated mode.
 -> need to seperated identifier CellID, PhiCellID, zCellID, ....
 -> no need to take into account multi hit from a single ionization point
 -> Jixie's minimum step size=0.07 cm ??? but why it is random ?



Commnet:

1/ changing the bonus_hitprocess.cc with MagBoltz electro drift transport formular and put the CellID at each ionization point.
-> This make to be visiable red-dots at each ionization point in graphic interface


GEMC options:

gemc **.gcard -G4TRACK_VERBOSITY=1 : print out all tracks


9/ There is a bug when I implemet Gasous D2 target in the cpp_material.cc that is one of the GEMC source files.
[Problem] proton minimum momentum is 72MeV/c that is way high from Kuhn and Jixie simulation....
[Reason] the mMixHeGasD and mMixDMEGasD should have a dimensionless definition of density.
[Solution] remove the "*mg/cm3" in line 73,74
Add "*kelvin" temperature unit in the line 81, 82
