Q) I don't know how to compile thee codes.....(no documentation)

Q) Overall a chain of simulation is not clear to me.....
ask to Jixie...
1/ for example, what BONUS (the very first step) is ? Is it EG ?
2/ GSIM+BONUS ...should be as detector simulation....
3/ Recontruction code for BONUS should be independent from CLAS ?


Q) How it works ? 
BONUS -> GSIM -> GPP -> RECONS
