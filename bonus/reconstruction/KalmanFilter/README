Note @ Dec.18,2015 KF meeting
check the fitting results with statistics 100event for example
with various momentum and angle of theta
p= 70,80,90,100,120 MeV/c
theta= 70, 80, 90, 100 deg

1/ try to calculate the delta_p /p_gen
where delta_p = p_gen - p_recon 

2/ Optimize the HelixFit result...(I know it does not affect to KF fit)

3/ maybe take a look at the delta_p/ p as a function p or theta dependence
